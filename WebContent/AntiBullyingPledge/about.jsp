			 	  	The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District believes that each student should be provided a safe, caring and socially-just learning environment where they have the ability and support to achieve.

					<p>Bullying has no place within school and the District strives to teach each student that they have a role to play in ensuring schools are safe places where bullying is not tolerated.

					<p>The purpose of the anti-bullying pledge is to engage students in a conversation about bullying, make them aware of the role they can play in preventing its occurrence and committing them to take an active role in creating safe, caring and socially just environments where bullying is not tolerated.

					<p>One student can make a difference and we want to show the strength of all our students.

					<p>Members of our school community who support this belief are encouraged to sign the pledge and make their support known.
