			 	  I am pleased to support an exciting initiative underway to promote bullying awareness, coinciding with activities for Pink Shirt Day which are taking place across the province and country. With the goal of starting a conversation in every classroom and unifying students behind a shared ideal, a new online pledge site has been launched by the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District. Welcome to that page!

<p>Our first-ever &quot;My Anti-Bullying Pledge&quot; is an agreement to be an agent for change. The pledge endorses the right of all students to learn in an environment that is safe, caring, and socially-just, and also encourages participants to stand up and take action to ensure they are part of the solution, rather than part of the problem. We want this pledge to help foster conversations in school and at home about how we can take steps to treat each other better, in all aspects of our lives.

<p>We encourage our schools, students and staff to share the pledge as wide as possible in their community - share it with your students and staff, encourage your school community, including parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, volunteers and others to participate and grow your school's participation as much as possible. While this is not a contest, we want each school to show the strong support they have to prevent bullying and offer a safe and caring learning environment.

<p>The website asks each of us to read the pledge and sign on as part of a school community, helping to grow our Anti-Bullying School Collage. Once a member of a school community signs the pledge, an image provided by that school will be added to the collage. Each additional pledge from a school's community will be counted by the website and will be visible for everyone to see. 

<p>We strongly believe that anti-bullying efforts are about more than just one day, one week or one month. We must create a culture of acceptance within our schools through discussion, understanding and action, as the examples of MyGSA and other LBGT school-based groups illustrate. Our awareness efforts need to be part of a continuous conversation, supported by each and every member of our staff, every single student and the entire school community. 

<p>I am hopeful everyone will see the benefit in signing the pledge and participating in this initiative. When our school communities, and our society as whole, agree to stand up against bullying and take a proactive role we create safe and caring learning environments where each student can excel both academically and personally.

<p>Let us all be inspired by the immortal words of Helen Keller and realize that, &quot;Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.&quot;

<p>Regards,<br/>
Darrin
