<p>I am an important member of my school community.

<p>I can be a positive influence on the people around me.

<p>I   care. I can create change. I can be a leader.

<p>In my community, bullies are not allowed.

<p>I believe everyone has the right to learn in an environment that is safe, caring, and socially-just.

<p>I refuse to be part of the problem. I commit to being part of the solution.

<br/>
<p><b>I PLEDGE:</b> 
<ul>
<li>to do my part to make my community a better place for everyone.
<p><li>that I will not humiliate, exclude or harm any member of my community.
<p><li>that I will treat all community members with respect and compassion.
<p><li>that I will be a good digital citizen, because what occurs online happens to real people.
<p><li>that if I see any member of my community being humiliated, excluded or harmed, I will stand up and let them know they are not alone.
</ul>
<br/>
<p><div align="center" style="font-size:14px;font-weight:bold;">I know standing up for someone is the right thing to do.
<p>I won't stand by...
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;color:Red;font-size:16px;">I WILL STAND UP!</span>
