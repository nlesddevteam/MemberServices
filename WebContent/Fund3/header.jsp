					The purpose of this website is to house all special project grant (SPG) information and documentation to ensure we meet the funding partner's 
					criteria for the use of the funds and to provide SPG continuity given the natural staff turnover that occurs. Its purpose is also to make it 
					simpler for staff to locate grant information and generate value added reports for more effective management of these grants. This is 
					important for accountability and transparency purposes as well as ensuring public confidence in the District so that 3rd parties continue to 
					provide funding to support our goal of student achievement.
