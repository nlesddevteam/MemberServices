Please note that the deadline to upload your vaccination records to your profile is this Friday December 17th.  You 
continue to receive this email because the District has not received your vaccination records as outlined in previous
correspondence to you. Failure to upload the appropriate vaccination record by the deadline will make you 
non- compliant with government policy and will result in you being placed on unpaid leave effective Monday December 20th.
<p>
<p>
Employees who are placed on unpaid leave and upload documents after the December 17th deadline are required to follow 
these steps prior to being approved to return to work

	1. Once the employee uploads their document they are required to advise the Regional HR Office of the same. The email 
	contact for your region was provided in the original memo on November 2nd.

	2. The District will review the uploaded document and verify its contents.  This process may take up to 7 calendar days.
	  Employees will remain on unpaid leave until their documents are verified. 
</p>
<p>
The District strongly encourages you to upload your vaccination records in the requested format prior to this date. 
Should you require assistance please contact your Regional HR office.

<p>
Please Note: If you are using an external email address on your profile you may receive this warning despite being verified. 
The District recommends that you change your email address in your profile to your @nlesd.ca email to prevent future message
warnings. Some employees have two profiles created - one under Teaching and one for Support and may need both if applying 
for Teacher/TLA or Support Staff positions. If you do not need the two profiles, the District may be able to delete one 
for you. It is important for your @nlesd.ca email to be included in the remaining profile. If you need both profiles it is 
recommended that you add the appropriate COVID vaccination document to both profiles for review and verification.  
The District thanks you in advance for your cooperation.
