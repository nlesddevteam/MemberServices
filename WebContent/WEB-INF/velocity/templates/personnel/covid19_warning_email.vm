You are receiving this email because the District has not yet received your vaccination records as outlined in a District memo 
sent on November 2, 2021. If you do not upload the appropriate vaccination record by next Friday, December 17, 2021 and have 
that record verified by District staff or have an approved exemption, you will be placed on unpaid leave. 
<p>
<p>
Employees who are placed on unpaid leave and upload documents after the December 17th deadline shall follow these steps prior to their return to work.

	1. Once the employee uploads their document they are required to advise the Regional HR Office of the same.  The email contact was provided in the 
	original memo on November 2nd.

	2. The District will review the uploaded document and verify its contents.  This process may take up to 7 calendar days.  Employees will remain on
	 unpaid leave until their documents are verified. 
</p>
<p>
The District strongly encourages you to upload your vaccination records in the requested format prior to this date. Should 
you require assistance please contact your regional HR office at the email address provided in the November 2, 2021 memo.

<p>
Please Note: If you are using an external email address on your profile you may receive this warning despite being verified.
The District recommends that you change your email address in your profile to your @nlesd.ca email to prevent future message
warnings. Some employees have two profiles created - one under Teaching and one for Support. Employees may need both profiles
if applying for Teacher/TLA or support staff positions. If you do not need the two accounts, the District may be able to 
delete one for you. It is important for your @nlesd.ca email to be included in the remaining profile. If you need both 
profiles it is recommended that you add the appropriate COVID vaccination document to both profiles for 
review and verification.
