As you are aware the District outlined expectations for all employees to provide vaccination records by December 17, 2021 
or have an approved exemption in place. 
<p>
<p>
You are receiving this email because the District has not yet received your vaccination records as per District memo on November 2, 2021. 
As per policy employees who have not uploaded their records by December 17, 2021, had that record verified by District staff or have an 
approved exemption will be placed on unpaid leave. 
</p>

<p>
The District strongly encourages all employees to upload their vaccination records prior to this date. Should you require assistance please 
contact your regional HR office at the email address provided in the November 2, 2021 memo.

<p>
Please Note: If you are using an external email address on your profile you would receive this warning despite being verified. The District recommends that you 
change your email address to your @nlesd.ca email to prevent future message warnings. Some employees have two profiles created - one under Teaching
 and one for Support.  Employees may need both profiles, if applying for TLA and Teacher positions and support positions.  If you do not need the two accounts, 
 the District may be able to delete one for you. It will be important for your @nlesd.ca email to be included the remaining profile.
If you need both accounts, it is recommended that add your COVID document to the other account as well for review and verification.

Thank you for your cooperation
