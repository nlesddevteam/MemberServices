The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District (NLESD) believes that a Professional Learning Plan (PLP) ensures that individual and organizational learning is maximized. The learning plan encourages individuals to expand their capacity to achieve their professional goals. This learning plan will identify the goals that the individual wishes to accomplish and specific strategies to action these goals. The Professional Learning Plan contributes to the overall progress of the organization.

<br/><br/>A Professional Learning Plan is designed to enable employees to focus on specific aspects of their professional development that they identify as priorities. It is rooted in both the District Strategic Plan as well as the School Growth and Development Plan as well as the individual professional needs of the teacher. The continuous and deliberate learning that takes place should sustain members of the organization throughout the various phases of their career.

<p>The goals developed within the Professional Learning Plan should adhere to these guidelines:
<ul>
<li>all goals should be specific
<li>all goals should be measurable
<li>all goals should be attainable
<li>all goals should be realistic 
<li>all goals should be achievable within an academic year.
</ul>
